<h2>Plain HTML inclusion</h2>
The "plain HTML" content below is the inclusion of file "common.html".<p/>
<h3>START OF common.html</h3>
<div w3-include-html="common.html"></div>
<h3>END OF common.html</h3>

<!--
    The above code shows that you can include some HTML.
    Can we use this functionality to include some JS files, by creating
    an HTML file that includes some <script> tags, and then including that
    file???
-->
<div w3-include-html="common-script-tags.html"></div>
<script>
    function onHelloClick() {
        // alert("function onHelloClick says Hello!")
        alert(greetings_hello());
    }
</script>

<hr/>

<h2>Script tags inclusion</h2>
The two buttons below invoke methods that print an alert.

<p/>
The button below simply invokes:  <em>alert("HTML page says Hello!")</em>, and
it works as expected.<br/>

<button onclick='alert("HTML page says Hello!")'>Hello 1</button><br/>

<p/>

The button below invokes the <em>hello</em> function which is defined in the
<em>greetings.js</em>. This file is SUPPOSED to be loaded by including the html file
<em>common-script-tags.html</em>, which includes a &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tag that loads
<em>greetings.js<em/>. Unfortunately, it does not seem to work, as the browser
    complains that the <em>hello()</em> function is not defined.<br/>

    <button onclick='hello()'>Hello 2</button>
